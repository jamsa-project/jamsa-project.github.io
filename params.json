{"name":"Jamsa","tagline":"Blind helper","body":"### What's Jamsa?\r\nJamsa Project is a blind helper system that aims to allow blind people being more aware of their environment. To achive this we have developed a smart glove that interacts with RFID tags.\r\n\r\nThe glove communicates with an Android device [jamsa-mobile](https://github.com/jamsa-project/jamsa-mobile) that requests the tag information to a server [jamsa-server](https://github.com/jamsa-project/jamsa-server) and executes an action.\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nIt is already the XXI century and blind people still **only** uses a white cane to know their environment. The technology already exists so we only have to put everything together.\r\n\r\n### Components\r\nWe have used:\r\n* ID-20LA RFID sensor. RFID sensor with integrated antenna.\r\n * https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11828\r\n* SEN-09963. USB towith FTDI chip\r\n * https://www.sparkfun.com/products/9963\r\n* Mobile device (any Android device with 3.1 or higher will do it).\r\n * Theses have been used for testing: Samung Galaxy S3/Samsung Galaxy Nexus/Nexus 5\r\n* OTG Cable\r\n* Gloves :)\r\n* Linux server with a [REST API](https://github.com/jamsa-project/jamsa-server) developed in perl and the web framework [Dancer](http://www.perldancer.org/).\r\n\r\n### PoC\r\n\r\n\r\n### Next Steps\r\nWe have only deployed a PoC to check that the idea is feasible so the next steps would be:\r\n* ble\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n* Fernando Apesteguía Santiago\r\n* Rubén Revilla Pérez\r\n* Rafael Casado Sánchez\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
